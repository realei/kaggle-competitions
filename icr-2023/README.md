# Introduction

This is a great dataset for learning Machine Learning. It is a tabular dataset with only around 6000 rows in the training set, which makes it very beginner-friendly. This is also my first time working with a tabular dataset. I am excited to participate in this competition and learn more about tabular dataset analysis, processing, and modeling. I plan to use a generic ML project pipeline and share my notebook. If there is any way I can improve, please feel free to provide feedback and comments.
